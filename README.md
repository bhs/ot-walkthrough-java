# drüç©nutz: An OpenTracing Walkthrough

Welcome to Dronutz! This is a sample application and OpenTracing walkthrough,
written in Java.

OpenTracing is a vendor-neutral, open standard for distributed tracing. To
learn more, check out [opentracing.io](http://opentracing.io), and try the
walkthrough below!

In addition to doing the walkthrough yourself, the results of each step are
saved in their own git branch.
- `git checkout step-1` to see dronutz with turnkey/network tracing.
- `git checkout step-2` to see an example of application-level client tracing.

## Step 0: Setup Dronutz
### Getting it
Clone this repository and build the jar file (for this, Maven must be
installed):

```
git clone github.com/carlosalberto/ot-walkthrough-java
cd ot-walkthrough-java/dronutz
mvn package
```

### Running
Dronutz has two server components, `API` and `Kitchen`, which
communicate each other over HTTP - they are, however, part of
the same process:

```
./scripts/run_kitchen.sh config_example.properties
```

In your web broswer, navigate to http://127.0.0.1:10001 and get yourself
some donuts.

### Pick a Tracer
Only `lightstep` is supported at the time, but supported for
a logging and a `zipkin` one will be added soon.

#### lightstep
If you're using lightstep, you will need your access token.

```properties
tracer=lightstep
tracer_host=LS_HOST
tracer_port=LS_PORT
tracer_access_token=LS_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

## Step 1: TurnKey Tracing
When you go to add tracing to a system, the best place to start is installing
OpenTracing plugins for the OSS components you are using. Instrumenting your
networking libraries, web frameworks, and service clients quickly gives you a
lot of information about your distributed system, without requiring you to
change a lot of code.

To do this, let's change the startup of the application to include tracing.

### Start the GlobalTracer
In OpenTracing, there is a concept of a global tracer for everyone to access,
As a convenience, we already have a function `configureGlobalTracer` that
works with the dronutz configuration file. In the `main` of 
`dronutz/src/main/java/com/otsample/api/App.java`, right after the configuration
file was loaded, do:

```java
        Properties config = loadConfig(args);
        if (!configureGlobalTracer(config, "dronutz"))
            throw new Exception("Could not configure the global tracer");
```

After this, the tracer will be available globally through
`io.opentracing.GlobalTracer.get()`.

### Instrument the outgoing HTTP requests.
Our `api` component communicates with the `kitchen` one over HTTP using
the `OkHttp` library, so we will instrument those requests using a middleware.
In `dronutz/src/main/java/com/otsample/api/KitchenConsumer.java`, inside the
the `KitchenConsumer` constructor:

```java
    TracingInterceptor tracingInterceptor = new TracingInterceptor(
             GlobalTracer.get(),
             Arrays.asList(SpanDecorator.STANDARD_TAGS));
    client = new OkHttpClient.Builder()
            .addInterceptor(tracingInterceptor)
            .addNetworkInterceptor(tracingInterceptor)
            .build();
```

### Instrument the inbound HTTP kitchen server.
Similarly, we will use a middleware to trace the incoming HTTP
requests for the `kitchen` component. In
`dronutz/src/main/java/com/otsample/api/KitchenContextHandler.java`,
inside the constructor do:

```java
    TracingFilter tracingFilter = new TracingFilter(GlobalTracer.get());
    addFilter(new FilterHolder(tracingFilter), "/*", EnumSet.allOf(DispatcherType.class));
```

After this, the incoming requests to `kitchen` will be traced too.

### Check it out in yout Tracer
Now that we're all hooked up, try buying some donuts in the browser. You should
see the traces appear in your tracer.

Search for traces starting belonging to the `dronutz` component to see the
patterns of requests that occur when you click the order button.

## Step 2: Enhance
Now that the components in our system are linked up at the networking level, we
can start adding application level tracing by tying multiple network calls
together into a single trace.

In dronutz, we'd like to know the time and resources involved with buying a
donut, from the moment it is ordered to when it is delivered. Let's add
OpenTracing's context to the requests from the `api` component to the
`kitchen` one. In `dronutz/src/main/java/com/otsample/api/ApiContextHandler.java`
in `OrderServlet` do:

```java
        @Override
        public void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
            throws ServletException, IOException
        {
            Span orderSpan = GlobalTracer.get().buildSpan("order_span").start();
            request.setAttribute("span", orderSpan);
```

And then, at the end of this same method:

```java
            Utils.writeJSON(response, statusRes);
            orderSpan.finish();
        }
```

Here we are creating a top level span that will be the parent of all
the traced operations happening when ordering a set of donuts, and after that
we store it in our `HttpServletRequest` object, so we can retrive this information
next. In `dronutz/src/main/java/com/otsample/api/KitchenConsumer.java` inside
`addDonut` add a `TagWrapper` instance with the parent span:

```java
    Span parentSpan = (Span) request.getAttribute("span");
    Request req = new Request.Builder()
        .url("http://127.0.0.1:10001/kitchen/add_donut")
        .post(body)
        .tag(new TagWrapper(parentSpan.context())) 
        .build();

```

This way, we are marking these requests as children of our main Span, and they
will appear in the tracer properly organized, as belonging to the same operation.

And we're done! Buy some donuts, check out the spans under the `dronutz`, component
and notice how the order and polling requests are now grouped under a single span,
with timing information for the entire operation.

### Step 3: Have fun
If you still have time, try to trace other things! For example, maybe we would
like to do have a main span when calling the `status` operation (the one polling
the status of the order) at the `StatusServlet` and the `KitchenConsumer.getDonuts`
call, like we did in the previous step with `OrderServlet` and `KitchenConsumer.addDonut`,
respectively.

## Thanks for playing, and welcome to OpenTracing!
Thanks for joining us in this walkthrough! Hope you enjoyed it. If you did, let 
us know, and consider spreading the love! 

A great way to get the feel for OpenTracing is to try your hand at instrumenting 
the OSS servers, frameworks, and client libraries that we all share. If you make
one, consider adding it to the growing ecosystem at 
http://github.com/opentracing-contrib. If you maintain a library yourself, 
plase consider adding built-in OT support.

We also need walkthroughs for languages other than Golang. Feel free to reuse 
the client, protobufs, and other assets from here if you'd like to make one.

TurnKey Tracing proposal at http://bit.ly/turnkey-tracing.

_Aloha!_
